    <h1 style="font-family:'blockgame'; font-size: 24px;"> Maxwell's Utopia <br>
   Night of January 27, 2018.</h1>
    I’m at a nondescript playground; I can’t exactly tell which playground it is but it has a color scheme similar to that of Cottonwood Point’s. I’m in the body of a small child, maybe six years old. There are a lot of other children playing kickball on the blacktop, but I’m confused because they’re playing kickball with a basketball. There are no parents here, though a couple teenagers loiter near the swings. <br> <br>

    The sky is a dark charcoal and when I look directly at it, it feels like it is falling on me. I stop looking up. The colors around me are muted; the vibrant orange ladders and rails are reduced to a dull copper. Black mulch beneath my feet darken the bottoms of my white shoes, and for a moment I’m upset. The feeling quickly subsides. Laughter and yelling from the small children overwhelm my ears, and I try to cover my ears, but it does nothing to stop the incessant pounding of sound. I’m not moving, not going anywhere, not playing with anyone. I’m just standing on the mulch, facing away from everybody, but I am still aware of everything that’s happening. I can see groups of small, screaming children playing tag on the playground, groups playing soccer in the grass, every child having the time of their life, just to be picked up by mom an hour later and return the next day. Every single day. I realize that with everything I’m hearing and feeling, I can’t see anything in front of me. I am only able to perceive things that I am not directly focusing on. Still unmoving, I am forced to hear all the yelling and forced to feel all the stomping feet and not experience any of it. Though, amidst all this, I don’t feel left out.  <br> <br>

    For a moment, everything stops. The overcast sky lightens and the children stop playing to look up. Everybody is silent; the only sound heard is the wind rushing past us and flowing into a dense forest of dancing trees. Then, laughter turns to screaming and playing turns to sprinting. A cold front is coming in from on top of us and nobody wants to be caught in the storm. <i>The storm will kill us,</i> I remember thinking. The children are terrified. Still, they keep running, all in the same direction: away from the parking lot and into the trees.  <br> <br>

    Finally, I’m alone at the playground with swirling winds picking up all around me. I slowly begin to put one foot in front of the other, among the presence of this foreboding unknown. I don’t have anywhere to go; home is anywhere. <i>It's my own brain.</i> The wind is intense, gale-force at this point, and the sky is pitch-black. I look around and see trash cans flying and asphalt being ripped from the ground. Trees struggle to hold onto the ground and some branches are already caught in the wind’s swirling current. The angry, bubbling sky roars above me, but for some reason, I can’t feel the wind. I’m anchored to where I stand and I don’t want to risk untethering myself by walking any further, so I stop. I’m on the edge of the playground, where mulch turns to asphalt.   <br> <br>

    I can see a cat, which is also not flying through the air. It’s a cotton-colored cat with a black blob on its stomach and side, standing about thirty feet in front of me. Staring at me, it stands on its hind legs, and it seems very nonchalant despite the literal hurricane occurring around us. Neither of us has anywhere to go, yet the cat telepathically reminds me that I should be going somewhere.  <br> <br>

    “Where?” I ask the cat out loud, but he does not respond. Maybe my voice was lost to the wind. A pair of feline eyes simply stare at me. I walk forward hesitantly despite being surrounded by a storm, and bend over to pet the cat. It’s on all fours now, embracing my pet. <i>Petting cats is so fun,</i>  I think. It’s so soft and cute and adorable. It does that cat thing where it walks around your ankles in a figure-8 motion. The volume of its purring rivals that of the howling wind around us. <br> <br>

    I think of my dog, Sully, and how he’s so different from this cat. This cat would never bite me. This cat would never ignore me when I pet it. This cat would never put it upon itself to single-handedly deter any guest from ever entering our house. I pet this cat for about five minutes when I decide that I’m going to take the cat home. Home, to my real house that I had forgotten about because I’m a child in an abandoned playground during a hurricane.   <br> <br>

    The cat is speaking to me, but not out loud. A jumble of different languages blare inside my head, until the cat seems to figure out its telepathy and tells me a lot of things that I do not understand nor remember, as well as something about it being a wizard (?). Most importantly, it conveys that our souls are intrinsically linked, that I am its best friend from another life. This makes me so happy because, as a six year old, my best friend is a telepathic wizard cat.  <br> <br>

    The cat and I walk home, him walking on his hind legs. He introduces himself as Maxwell. I thought that name was SO CUTE when I heard him say it in my head. At this point, the wind has died down quite a bit and the sky is clear, but still dark because it’s nighttime. I realize I have no idea where my house is, and I see the cat make a very slow blink. Trees in front of us snap and bend and rearrange into an arched opening that leads into my backyard.   <br> <br>

    My house is completely unlit, and the ceiling was the floor, and the floor was the ceiling. Maxwell and I walk to my basement, still walking on its hind legs. My basement has morphed into a huge pit about the size of half a football field. It’s also unlit and the walls are crumbling dirt. Oil lanterns line the ground. The stairs end abruptly, with a drop of 20 feet remaining to the bottom. Wooden rafters criss-cross the rest of the open space as walkways.  <br> <br>

    You know the scene at the end of Interstellar where Matthew McConaughey is in that 5th dimensional space where he fell into the black hole? My basement kind of looked like that.  <br> <br>

    The water heater is floating in midair, which I’m confused about, but Maxwell seems to disregard it, so I follow suit.   <br> <br>

    As we walk along thin wooden rafters, I see my mom, embroidering a thin gray cloth by hand near my dad’s jig-saw, instead of on her usual embroidering machine. She asks me why I have a cat walking with me. I tell her his name is Maxwell and we’re best friends so our family has to accept the cat. My mom sighs and for some reason allows me to keep the animal. Maxwell thanks me inside my head. I realize how tired I am ever since the whole hurricane thing happened and all the walking and 5th dimensional basement thing. We walk back upstairs, and even though all the lights are out and the sky is black, an odd silver light floods in through all the ground floor windows in my house. Unnerved, I sleep on the couch, with Maxwell curled up at my feet.  <br> <br>

    Dream-days pass, and I’m super happy because I have a cat, and he fits right in at home. Apparently he can’t telepathically speak to anybody except me, so I can’t talk to Maxwell around my family unless it’s cutesy pet talk.  <br> <br>

    One night, Maxwell wakes me up. I’m sleeping in my own bed that night, and I struggle to realize I’m awake until I see Maxwell over my face, meowing loudly for me to get <i>uuuuuuuuup.</i>  He does that cat stretch thing where he puts his front paws forward and stretches his paws to look like hands for a second and then arches his back. I turn to look at my phone clock, but the screen is blurry and dark. He motions me to follow him, and walks on his hind legs out my bedroom door and down the stairs. I don’t say anything in protest, because something in the back of my mind told me I didn’t really wake up. The thought of only dreaming about him within my dream made me sad.  <br> <br>

    We walk down my street, lit only by a few lampposts. When we reach the end, we turn and keep walking. Past streetlights, past schools and parking lots, past highways, we keep walking in a straight line until we reach what I am sure is Westport. Maxwell leads me to a one-way street lined by ivy-covered houses on both sides. We stand in the middle of the street for a while. The ambient city noise fills us with a fresh relief. Distant cars pass along, street lights dotting the road stutter and blink, the electric hum of air conditioners all compete to fill the silence. There’s little light pollution because of all the broken lights, and I can see all the sky’s constellations. <br> <br>

    Maxwell interrupts my thinking by tugging at my leg and pointing at a sewer grate cover in the middle of the road. I ask him where it goes, but my mind remains silent. He looks at it, and suddenly the cover is gone. He looks back at me and drops onto all fours and walks around my ankles, doing that thing again. I find myself walking toward the sewer hole, but something is keeping me from making it there. Suddenly, I find myself climbing down the narrow hole with Maxwell hitching a ride on my shoulder. The metal ladder is rusted, but the rust is green and mossy. <br> <br>

    The cat and I continue to descend the seemingly endless ladder. We are enveloped in near-complete darkness, and the top of the hole is just a dot when I look up. I can hear Maxwell in my head now, telling me to look at him. <br> <br>

    <i>We’re in the void,</i> he says.<i> A dimension between dimensions. </i> (I am quite sure this is word for word) Then, my brain told me that <i> i can’t look down or else i’ll fall and i can't escape the void.</i> I don’t even know what direction is down. Maxwell continues to tell me the rest of the rules of the void, but I zone out and realize that even though there’s no light, I can see Maxwell clearly. I bring my hands up to my face, and no matter how much I try, I can’t see them. <br> <br>

    I try really really really hard to not look down. And it works! I don’t look down at all but only because Maxwell would close my eyes whenever I would just barely start to look downwards. We finally reach the bottom of the ladder, and my feet hit solid material. Maxwell walks somewhere and I follow. We walk for what seems like an actual eternity. This dream is too long, I remember thinking. I can see in the distance of this black void a mesh of people’s lives condensed into a single image. Millions of specks on an invisible horizon pass me as I continue to walk.  <br> <br>

    Eventually, the blackness around me turns to paved road, fresh air, and huge, magnificent redwood trees. It’s a new world that looks so unlike anything I’ve seen on Earth. The air smells like cotton candy and the sky is a swirl of pastel sunset colors. Massive trees taller than skyscrapers loom over Maxwell and me as he continues to guide me down the solid white, marble-y road. The entirety of the world I’m taking in is breathtaking, but for some reason, I’m not at peace. It’s completely empty. A paradise in which anybody could be, any time, just one sewer grate away, and there’s not a living soul except for Maxwell and me.  <br> <br>

    <i>This is heaven!</i> I’m not sure if Maxwell says this to me, or if the wind– <i>wow, the feeling of the wind on my face is divine</i>– whispers it into my ears. We continue to walk. I almost convinced myself this was completely and truly real. The massive redwoods twist in and out of buildings and their branches form paths of their own as we walk past them. The city is constantly moving, despite its emptiness. “Why did you take me here?” I ask my cat. <i>This is my home,</i> I hear him tell me. <i>I thought you’d like it here.</i>

    Words cannot even begin to describe how serene I felt. 

    An overwhelming wave of realization crashes over me. The cat lives in this world all alone. The itch in the back of my head tells me that this isn’t his original world. My brain tells me this perfect world was created to be empty, uninhabited. I couldn’t see the point in leaving such a paradise alone forever. I want to stay here forever, or at least come back later.  <br> <br>

    Maxwell tells me it’s time to go. I protest, but he looks at me firmly. <i>But,</i> I thought to him, <i>you must take me back here.</i>  <br> <br>

    —- <br> <br>

    Over a long period of time, maybe months, Maxwell and I visit our secret world almost every night. The long walks to the city and through the void allow him to tell me about where he came from. He’s not really from our Earth, but he’s not really an alien. <br> <br>

    Essentially, he came from an Earth of another timeline, and realized people are evil and decided to leave at the time humans and cats evolved to be smart enough to accomplish interdimensional travel… He has been searching for thousands of years for some perfect society to inhabit, but he's grown quite lonely and instead decided to settle down on my Earth. Here, he found the portal to this perfect place, but initially didn't know how to enter. So, he just started hanging around on my Earth and grew to quite enjoy some of it. Eventually he found me and decided to show me his empty world.  <br> <br>


    One day, we’re leaving the heaven-world when, unlike every other day, we can’t find the door out: the transition from utopia to void. Maxwell starts yelling numbers at me. Everything is getting blurry, the sky is melting and the trees are withering. The world is telling us to stay, but Maxwell is shouting for the world to let me go. I ask him why he won’t come with me. The wind is pushing him back to the city, and he yells at me to remember a long string of numbers. "It’s the key out," he yells. The world will only let one of us leave.  <br> <br>

    “No!” I scream. I love Maxwell the cat. He was my best friend! My soul-twin! I’m crying now, because the world pushes me back into the void without Maxwell. The final journey through the blackness is soundtracked by my screaming for Maxwell. I return the way I came: through the void, into the sewer, up the ladder, only to find the sewer grate cover back on. I can’t lift it. Instead of yelling for help, I just sit at the top of the ladder and cry because I’ll never see Maxwell again.  <br> <br>

    He was so cool.
