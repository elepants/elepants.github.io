         <td style="width: 100%; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; float:inline-start;"> <h1 style="font-family:'bitfont'; color: #420C14;">love list</h1><strong>Silvia Prieto</strong> <br> So hilariously dry. I think there's a little bit of Silvia in all of us. <br> <br> <strong>Los Conductos </strong> <br> One of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen, and by that I mean it provoked a single thought many many times..."what?" <br> <br> <strong>Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind </strong><br> 100/10 best film score in all of film history ever. RIP Joe <br> <br> <strong>Princess Mononoke</strong> <br> I learned a few songs from the soundtrack on piano before I ever even watched the movie, but I think that allowed me to really appreciate the lovely thematic interplays between plot and melody. also the movie is really pretty ;) <br> <br><strong>Amores Perros</strong> <br> Really liked the composition of this movie... it wields non-linear storytelling in such a jarring way that it gave me emotional whiplash. Despite the chaos, I really think it's a great watch if you have two and a half hours to kill. <br> <br> 
           <strong>Zombieland</strong> <br> Wonderfully stupid. Why and how did they get Bill Murray to cameo...??? <br> <br> <strong>honorable mentions: Kill Bill vol.1 & vol.2 </strong> <br> Maybe it's over-the-top. Maybe it's over-hyped. Maybe the weird foot scenes put people off. Don't care. I love these movies. Some people like Top Gun or John Wick, and I think I like Kill Bill for the same reasons. Super epic and hilariously unserious.

           <h1 style="font-family:'bitfont'; color: #420C14;"><strong>hate list</strong> </h1>
          <strong>Natural Born Killers </strong> <br> This movie is sticky and gross. And I don't like-- actually, I <i>detest</i>--Woody Harrelson, young and bald and with those stupid sunglasses. I can't take this movie seriously, and neither should you.
           <br> <br>
           <strong>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl</strong> <br> I guess it's a generally fun film, but it is so filled with cliches that it's just so hard to watch without jokingly predicting what's going to happen next and then it actually happening. It's like spoiling it for yourself as you watch it because it's so predictable.
           <br> <br>
           <strong>A Clockwork Orange</strong> <br> 
           Do not be fooled. I hate this movie. I have read and writ many an analysis over this story, and while it does obviously have enough merit to warrant film adaptations and academic studies, I still hate it. The social commentary of the film may be valuable in a generic discussion over totalitarian regimes or politics of self-determination, but I think there is an important line in the sand to draw where it just becomes not worth watching it.
