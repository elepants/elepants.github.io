      <h1 style="padding: 0; margin: 0; height: 30px;"> hi </h1>
      <p style="padding: 0; margin: 0;"> <br> I'm Eleanor. Also known as: AA, ele, elepants, and nesryn. <br> As you can tell, I like to spend time on my 'puter. However, I also like to garden and spend time in my yard. Those grackles aren't going to scare themselves off!!!! <br>  <br> Speaking of birds, my colleagues (roommates) and I also enjoy good 'ole hard work! We work (hang out in) the fields (yard) of my neighbors' farmstead (backyard), and take care of their chickens (we gave them a whole cabbage one time). <br> The chicken to the right is Buffy, she lets us pet her. <br>                    update: buffy died :( <br> </p> <p style="font-family: bitfont";> I'm at my most productive right before big storms. The calm air holds its breath, steadying me. <br> </p> 
      <p style="font-family: 'blockgame'";> the world is my oyster, which I with sword shall open!</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; line-height: 20px;" > <strong>My hands grasp the rectangular sides of the tank, sharp corners of the glass pinching my skin, the slow flow of water within. I’m talking out loud in my dream, but nobody is in the kitchen. After some time, I feel short bursts of vibration against the walls of the tank. The fish are swimming into the glass of the tank, wanting but unable to escape. I remember that all of the fish are blind too; they don’t know I’m holding their tank. </strong> </p> 
      <p style="font-family:monospace"> <strong>If there’s only 8 billion individual experiences of what the world is, we’ve lost. What is the point but to inhabit the world together? </strong></p>
