   Night of October 11, 2022.</h1>

    I was in a tall warehouse of some sort, or an office building. It was a skyscraper in a moderately bustling city. There were dozens of other people loitering about; I think the first floor was a bank, and so there were people interacting with tellers at the far wall, away from the tall glass doors. The first floor itself was immense; the ceiling was two or three stories high and tall, bright windows lined the entrance-facing wall. They were the only windows, and the bottoms of them were just higher than the tallest person in the room; they barely even lit the room either. There were no lights, so we relied on dim sunlight from these massive windows. The walls and floors were different muted shades of brown, and as I looked around to get a view of the whole space, the tellers’ stalls disappeared, and the tellers as well. Instead, against the back wall, devoid of any light or windows, sat a large metal device. It looked old and industrial, about the size of a small car. It generated a very low hum and occasionally whirred. <br> <br>

    Those sounds became the only sounds in the room as I began to fixate on it. I felt like I was the only person in the room then, staring at this monster machine. I snapped out of my short daze and looked around again, and suddenly there were much fewer people in the room, only a couple dozen. The gleaming windows were crudely barricaded with huge planks of wood, and sunlight fought its way inside from the perimeters.The doors were shut and blocked by myriad furniture, metal pipes, and every other piece of furniture in the room. It was darker suddenly, too.
     <br> <br>
    He did it because he could. No other reason. To see how long he could keep it going. <br> <br>
    He took us all hostage, directing some kind of cruel game in which he was the only one who could win or lose. He somehow had blocked us all in, trapped us, and we were stuck in this building for what felt like weeks. Journalists, reporters, a huge swarm of police, and other law enforcement swarmed the building, but did not enter. Because the machine was a bomb, and he built it himself. It would kill everyone, even those outside. And so they desperately tried to negotiate. These negotiations turned into an exchange of food and supplies for those inside in return for one more day of intact bodies of the hostages inside. <br> <br>

    The bomb occasionally hissed and whirred, making us always aware of its presence in the building in a crude, Chinese-water torture kind of way. We lived for days or weeks or however long sitting on the floor and just talking to each other. But we had a mission, a goal. <br> <br>

    He had given us a riddle, but it was more like a question; he seemed to be asking it seriously, and if we could tell him the correct answer, then he would let us all leave. But the question was incredibly cryptic. It was something like, “What is #%@& ’s real name?” I couldn’t remember the name. But it wasn’t a name, it was more like a username, a pseudonym. He supplied us all with technology, secretly knowing it would really be of no use to us. The hostages then, we became divided. Some of us thought it was a philosophical question, like who <i>is</i> he? Some of us thought it was mathematical, that it was merely a hint to defusing the bomb and not a question at all. Some of us thought the answer truly was somewhere deep in the depths of the internet, places where only few had trodden.  <br> <br>

    I remember sitting with the philosophical group first. We pondered the words he said pretty much at face value. We tried to think of people we knew he knew, but nobody really knew very much about him. But I did. I didn’t tell them I knew him, but I knew that he would never pose a question to be interpreted like this. So I left their group. <br> <br>

    I then consulted the mathematical group; it was a very mismatched group, with some very young children that seemed like geniuses or something, and older men who could have been engineers or something. We had all been warned not to mess with the machine, because it was expertly crafted, with any slight deviation or movement to the machine able to set off a series of chains and pulleys to complete the detonation circuit, killing us all. The only mechanism that looked  usable was a set of 20ish small levered-switches on the side of the machine. I assumed that was how he would defuse it. But the math people were too scared to act on any of their ideas anyway, and so I left. They remained there, just pondering pretentiously but otherwise doing nothing. <br> <br>

    The last group was the largest,  but not by much. They were all sitting in a line at a long, skinny white table with high-top chairs. Nobody spoke to each other. I took a seat at an empty laptop and realized everybody was typing stuff, browsing the internet. I began to type, searching idly. I clicked reddit link after link, searching for this person. I visited every obscure site known to man. <br> <br>

    I found someone, a vague and small page somewhere on a dark-mode website. They seemed to know something about our captor and I direct messaged them for a while. There were a lot of dead end leads though, as the media and newspapers had our whole building on lockdown as well.  <br> <br>

    Day after day passed as we consulted him with our findings, begging for one of them to be the correct answer. But each time he denied us, completely stonefaced. <br> <br>
    One day he was going to go outside, a taunt to all of those spectating us so closely. I wanted to go outside. For some reason, he allowed me to bug him, to hound him, wanting to go outside. For some reason, he allowed me to accompany him. Just a short walk around the building’s perimeter, out the back and away from the main horde of spectators. Of course, there were huge barricades quite a distance away separating the perimeter of the expected blast-radius from the general public. We remained within the barriers, but once we stepped outside I felt sun hit my skin for what felt like the first time, and a cold wind gently bit my arms. I had no coat; I was going to get cold, but I was not going to pass up this opportunity. <br> <br>

    <i>Opportunity,</i> I thought.<i> Will I run?</i> I could easily escape. I knew I would be able to jump my way out, or fly, whatever mode my semi-lucidity could conjure. But I was confident I could leave at any time.  <br> <br>

    Interrupting my thoughts, he grabbed my hand and squeezed gently, but I knew what it meant. <i>Leave, and they all die.</i> He had full control over them, and despite the lightness of my feet and the height of my step, I knew he still had the upper hand. He controlled the bomb. Being outside would not change that. <br> <br>

    We walked silently, hand in hand, until we rounded another corner of the building. Cameras suddenly flashed and I heard a roar of yelling. Nobody dared jump the barrier, nobody dared approach or even look at him. They were yelling at me, telling me to run. They thought I was an offering of peace, or that he was going to slowly let us go. <br> <br>

    But it was a taunt. <i>Come and get me,</i> I imagined him thinking. But they wouldn’t.  <br> <br>

    Someone yelled something to the effect of, “RUN, Eleanor. You can escape now!, It's not your fault, save yourself!” and for some reason, that thought resonated with me, and my previous resolution to remain dissolved, and I launched myself into the air, at great spectacle to those around me. Midair, I froze. His eyes burned into me, but looking down he was still stonefaced, to my fury. I couldn't read him, it frustrated me. The fact that he could  remain calm enraged me. I looked from him to the crowd, holding their arms out to me.  <br> <br>

    I looked back at him. I dropped from the sky, back into the confines of his hands.  <br> <br>

    We walked back inside. Life continued within.  <br> <br>

    He knew his fortress was impenetrable, and was able to taunt it effortlessly. He was calm, always already knowing his next move. Remaining horrifyingly straight-faced. he turned to stare at me directly. I could see his face clearly now. <br> <br>

    He was Sam.
