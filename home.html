    <p> <br>You have found my internet archives. I do a lot of things on my 'puter, so this is the site I built to house everything. <br> <br>
    I coded this entire website from scratch with HTML and CSS via replit. <br> I hope you enjoy rummaging through my stuff as much as I enjoyed putting it all together. <br> <br>
    <b>Note:</b> I am not a graphic designer, so sorry if anything is formatted terribly or is ugly. You can send your grievances <a href="grievances.html"> <b>here</b></a>. <br> Mobile formatting is so hard T_T </p>

    I decided to make this site to see if I could actually do it. Somehow, it        has evolved into a continuous labor of love. By love, I mean continuous          frustration and trying slightly different things over and over until             sometimes for some reason it works. ;)

    <p class="musicintro" style="text-align:left;"> I use an online browser          called Jummbox to make music. It's a free and intuitive site created by John     Nesky that lets you make music note-by-note, and play it in real time. <br>      <br> I started out in 2021 intending to make a resource pack for the             minecraft server my friends and I shared. Over time, I've found myself with      a huge, disorganized folder of links to completed songs. <br> <br> One of        the primary reasons I made this website was to house all of my music, and to     make it easier to share.
