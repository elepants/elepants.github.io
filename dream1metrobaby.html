    <h1 style="font-family:'blockgame'; font-size: 24px;"> Metronome Baby <br>
   Night of February 17, 2024.</h1>

    I was at my parents’ house. Standing at the threshold of the piano room, I eyed the piano, wanting to play. It felt like it had been an immensely long amount of time since I had last played it. Though…something was stopping me from immediately walking over and sitting at the bench. <br> <br>

    My eyes wandered around the room. Directly next to the piano was a small, green-velvet plush loveseat. It was shaped like it was meant for two people, though it was so ridiculously small that a single person would have to fight the chair to actually sit in it. I remember thinking it must have been imported.  <br> <br>

    There was a baby in the seat. <br>
    It was fussing… it had been fussing the entire time I was pondering the impossibility of the chair it was laying in. My mind felt blank… I had absolutely no clue what to do with the child in front of me. Because the baby was on this seat-thing, though, all it would take was a slight movement and it would fall off the open edge– something that I had to prevent at all costs. I call out to my mom, “whose child is this? he can’t be lying here…?” She only responds that the baby is so young that he hasn’t figured out how to move his limbs and thus cause himself to fall; therefore, he is safe where he is. <i>Besides, </i> I remember her adding, <i>he would love to listen to you play piano.</i>  <br> <br>

    I had forgotten about the piano. I suddenly remembered how much I wanted to play. Hesitantly heeding my mother’s assurance, I sat down on the bench. The fussing baby to my right began to quiet. I started with Beethoven’s Six Ecossaises; this was the most realistic piano-playing I’ve ever done in a dream. My fingers felt as if the keys had springs, with the music causing my fingers to bounce with the rhythm.  <br> <br>

    As soon as I started playing, my rhythm began to fall apart. Right as my fingers hit the keys, someone’s voice began to drown out the music: ONE-AND-TWO-AND-THREE-AND- <br>
    I remember thinking,<i> this song isn’t even in threes,</i>  and my frustration at the obnoxious metronomic voice grew. I was playing at a completely different tempo than the voice, and the conflicting inputs short-circuited my muscle memory. I stopped playing.  <br> <br>

    I started over. Again, I made it only a few measures before <i>ONE-AND-TWO-AND-THREE-AND-</i> I was irate, and swirled around in the bench to find the godforsaken device that was ruining my peace. It was the baby. The voice was coming from the baby. He looked so smug, as smug as a baby can look, I guess.   <br> <br>

    In my rage, the only thing I could think of to do was to look at the baby, and firmly ask, “Have you even heard of rubato?” I felt as stupid saying it as it sounded.   <br>     <br>
