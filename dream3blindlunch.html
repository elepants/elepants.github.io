    <h1 style="font-family:'blockgame'; font-size: 24px;"> Lunch with the Blind Woman <br>
   Night of June 28, 2022.</h1>

    I was a younger version of myself, young enough to be accompanied everywhere by my mom, who was also younger. But it was fun. I enjoyed my time with her, and one of the places we went on our special day (I didn’t know what the occasion was!) was the house of a slightly older woman with blonde hair and a kind face. She was blind, or at least that’s what I was told. It was her birthday today! My mom and I came to bring her a special treat; a little platter of hors d'oeuvres. We knew she would love them. While the woman didn’t look like her, she reminded me a lot of Ms. A. She was great. We sat down in her house, which was also some kind of Mediterranean restaurant of some sort, but only in the dining room.  <br> <br>

    At some point in the dream, I had some anxiety over getting to a softball game. I wasn’t even sure if I had a game that day, but I looked down and realized I was in my old purple uniform. I had my braided pigtails with ribbons tied at the ends. I needed to make sure I didn’t miss my game. I took out my phone and called Emily Farthing. She would know, for sure.  <br> <br>

    The phone call never went through, but I didn’t really worry about it. I remembered I was a kid, so worrying was my mom’s job. While we hung out with the blind woman, we took a seat at the “restaurant” table, which was just a platform slightly above the ground, like a chabudai. We sat and talked, and after a while we ordered a few bites from the menu, but not too much! (because I had a softball game right after this) It’s early afternoon/late morning. Mom says we can come back after for a true lunch, but to just get a bite now. This plan was foiled as the restaurant staff accidentally brought us full plates of food. I stuffed as much shawarma in my face that I could before we left but I’m still hungry. I’m just glad we would come back after. <br> <br>

    I wake up to the sound of someone whispering my name. Over and over. At least ten times. The first was the loudest and clearest, and after the second or third I was fully awake. But the whisper got quieter and quieter, but still clearly whispering my name. The voice was nondescript, I couldn’t tell if it was male or female. Honestly, it kind of sounded like my voice. The more I focused on it, the more the voice seemed to intentionally get quieter. I could hear my heart pounding so fast; I became wide awake very quickly, really scared. It was 7:20AM. <br> <br>
