    <h1 style="font-family:'blockgame'; font-size: 24px;"> The Crane <br>
   Night of August 23, 2021.</h1>
I am walking in a grassy field with an old man. He is explaining to me different natural aspects of the land. After some time of walking, we arrive at a treeline with many tall and thick oaks with holes in the sides (like the ones that owls like to sit in). The old man suddenly becomes very quiet, and I realize that he had been talking non-stop for the majority of our hike. Putting a hand up, he lets me know not to make any noise and whispers, “this is a rare occurrence, watch this!” and he reaches into his pocket and pulls out several slices of an orange and holds his hand out towards one of the tree-holes next to (and a little above) us.  <br> <br>


A large white wing is birthed from the tree, and then another, and then two spindly legs and a great feathery torso and head. A huge crane has just materialized from the inside of the tree and is now in front of us and gratefully eating the fruits offered by the old man. This crane is the most beautiful creature I have ever seen. I am filled with awe as I watch the next events unfold. Little by little, the crane slowly shifts into a humanoid figure, and then begins to take on more feminine details. The wings move to the being’s back, and arms form, graced with delicate and feathery skin. Her eyes are small but sharp, and her skin so light it still looks like it’s covered in feathers. Feathers seem to be falling from the sky as the air fills with flower petals. Everything is so beautiful; all of my senses are involved-- the sweet taste of citrus on my tongue, a sweet floral scent in the air, the beautiful sight in front of me, the light rustling of wind and grass whistling past my ears, and the soft feathers I feel between my fingers as I reach for them in awe, clutching them against my chest. <br> <br>
