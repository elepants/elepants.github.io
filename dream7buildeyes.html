   Night of October 23, 2019.</h1>
    I’m sitting criss-crossed on the table rug in my kitchen, near the table. There’s a small, enclosed fish tank in my lap, but I can’t see it. I’m blind. <br><br>

    All I experience is my thoughts and my sense of touch. My hands are holding the rectangular sides of the tank and feel the corners of the glass, the slow flow of water within. I’m talking out loud in my dream, but nobody is in the kitchen; the entire dream is me talking to fish. For a while, it’s nothing really memorable or exciting. <br><br>

    After some time, I feel short bursts of movement against the walls of the tank. The fish are swimming into the glass of the tank, wanting but unable to escape. I remember that all of the fish are blind too; they don’t know I’m holding their tank. <br><br>

    A large-sounding dog barks from somewhere at the front of my house. I hear it slowly pad over to the kitchen, the sounds of its claws changing from dull thuds on carpet to clicking on wood. It makes its way over to me, and it moves its head to where my hand is, wanting to be pet. My hands glide over the area where its eyes are supposed to be, but there’s none there. It’s just empty sockets. I feel pity for the dog, more than I felt for the fish. <br><br>


    I find scraps of some material on the ground near my feet; I can’t even begin to describe what it is. Maybe like the thickness and flexibility of seaweed, but it was metallic, and not anything like aluminum foil. I don’t know how I perceived it, but it was really dark with small discolored specks in it. I knew it could be cut by running through it multiple times with an exacto knife. Somehow I got it into my head that I would create new eyes for this dog, and I started folding and cutting this weird material into triangular and trapezoidal shapes. <br><br>

    I wake up before I finish.
