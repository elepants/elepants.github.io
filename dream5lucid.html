    <h1 style="font-family:'blockgame'; font-size: 24px;"> Semi-lucid declaration <br>
   Night of April 4, 2020.</h1>
    This dream takes place a month after all classes were canceled in early 2020. <br>

    I was in class, still in high school. I stood up and told everybody that I have come to the realization that nobody in this room is real– except for me, because school was canceled due to coronavirus. I explained that everyone had to be a part of my own consciousness and that I am the only reason they are real. This caused immense panic and chaos; people started screaming and crying and running out and having existential crises– absolute insanity. 
    
    <br> <br> Deciding to leave class as well, I walked around until I found Jenna, and told her– through tears– that she wasn't real but that I loved her. Jenna, unfazed by the news, became wide-eyed and frantically grabbed my arms, telling me I had to do something CRAZY. At this point, I’m completely lucid and understand I literally could do anything I want, but I was overwhelmed with all of my options and all I could think of to do is to find my friend Ben and steal his shoes.
