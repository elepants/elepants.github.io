    <h1> <br> Dream Journal Randomizer </h1>
    <p> I think this page will be the most difficult for me to create, because I want it to have a singular link that will redirect you to a randomly generated dream that I've recorded. <br> Because I have a dream journal that dates back to 2016, I have roughly seven years worth of dreams that I think are funny (others I need to vet) and would share here. But the entire idea is you can never choose which one you get when you click the button, and you'll probably never get the same one twice. <br> Anyways, that requires a bunch of planning and sorting through my stuff to actually make happen, and then I have to learn how to do that in HTML. So.........this page might be bare for a while. </p>
