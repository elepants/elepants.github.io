                You have found my internet archives. I do a lot of things on my 'puter, so I                             found a fun way to organize all of it into one place! <br> <br>
                I built this entire website from scratch with HTML and CSS via                                           replit. Thanks to stackoverflow and w3schools, since October 2023 I have taught                          myself how to make all (most) of this! (thanks, kaya). <br> 
                Hope you enjoy rummaging through my stuff as much as I enjoyed putting it                                all together. <br> <br>
                <b>Note:</b> I am not a graphic designer, so sorry if anything is formatted terribly or                  is ugly. You can send your grievances <a href="grievances.html"><b>here</b></a>. </p>

    <div class="box homecontent2">  <h3> <strong> the worldâ€™s mine oyster, which I with sword will open! </                  strong></h3> </strong>
                <p style="font-family:'bitfont';"> I really just decided to make this site to see if I could actually do it. Somehow, it has evolved into a continuous labor of love. By love, I mean continuous frustration and trying the same thing over and over until sometimes for some reason it works. ;) </p>

  <div class="homedream"> <h2 style="font-size:22px;">Hey!<br> Do you want to hear the dream I had last night?</h2>
    <p class="dreamintro" style="text-align:center;">
   I've been keeping a <a href="dreams.html">dream journal</a> since 2016. <br>Remembering your dreams is like flexing a muscle. The more you focus on remembering, the easier it becomes.<br>

  <div class="homemusic"> <h2 style="font-size:22px;">Jummbus</h2>
  <p class="musicintro" style="text-align:left;"> I use an online browser called Jummbox to make music. It's a free and intuitive site created by John Nesky that lets you make music note-by-note, and play it in real time. <br> <br>
    I started out in 2021 intending to make a resource pack for the minecraft server my friends and I shared. Over time, I've found myself with a huge, disorganized folder of links to completed songs. <br> <br> One of the primary reasons I made this website was to house all of my music, and to make it easier to share.
