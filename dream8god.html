   Night of May 2, 2020.</h1>

    I am speaking to God. It is a Giant, wearing red toned clothing. We are floating, but God is towering high above me, above the clouds. It morphs into an airplane, and I float over and sit on the top of the airplane. We are talking about something unimportant. Looking down, there are two pilots, a woman with dark pink hair and a man with no eyes. These are the humanoid manifestations that God chose to appear to me as. Yet part of its consciousness remained separate from the two people. Somehow it is revealed to me that this being is not all-capable, as if it is a lesser-deity to the all-powerful. Because of this, it decides that it wants my power. <br> <br> 
    <i> What power do I have to offer it? </i>I wonder; I feel honored, but I feel I don't deserve to become part of it. It disagrees, and soon I feel my own consciousness being melded with two others. There are four minds in one body, and as soon as it happens, it reverses. We split, and once again we are three separate entities– plus the consciousness with which I had been talking. <br> <br>

    As we fly, we find a large, low flying spacecraft which had supposedly been committing egregious crimes against humanity. The three of us go on a spree of all powerful destruction. <i>We are not the villains… right?</i> This question reverberates through my brain as I destroy the interior of the ship, seeing humanoid figures cower in fear. It felt good to destroy. I wanted more. Too soon, the dream faded, and I started drifting away.
