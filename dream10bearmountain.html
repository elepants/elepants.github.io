    <h1 style="font-family:'blockgame'; font-size: 24px;"> Bear Mountain <br>
   Night of September 25, 2020.</h1>

    I ran away from home. I stole my dad's truck and sped down the highway, going west. There was so much traffic, even though it was the dead of night. Faint radio music buzzed through the front speakers of this car and the taillights of cars in front of me danced and grew and swelled as I realized I was not wearing my glasses. I drove on anyway, slamming my foot on the gas. I could feel my heart racing as my giant vehicle accelerated– too fast. As I approached the car in front of me, my steering wheel morphed, and I pulled it upwards. The truck lifted from the ground and flew over the car ahead of me. I floored the gas again; I could now just fly over everybody and avoid the traffic. I was perpetually pressed to the back of my seat as my car sped forward. <br> <br>

    After a long time of driving, I was off the highway, and in a mountainous back-country area. The roads here were rocky and bumpy, and I decided to ditch the truck at a rest stop a ways back. I started walking, searching for a specific location that I've been to before, that I only know that I will know it when I see it. Walking up a hill, it turns into a mountain. Suddenly, there appears jagged wooden steps and wooden railings guiding me further upward.   <br> <br>

    At this point, I realize I'm in a wheelchair– I had been the whole time since I left my car. I try for a few moments to wheel myself upward, but it is just too hard to get up the hill like this. I hesitantly leave the comfort of the chair and feel my bare feet press against the uneven rocks and dirt. I step forward and forward. At a junction between two paths, I find hanging on a wooden post Erin's purple robe, which I grab, thinking she will want it. It meant that we had all been here before, my roommates and I, and Erin had left her robe because she had been leaving in such a rush. I take the path that had Erin's robe hanging on it, and try to remember what it was about where I was going that caused this.   <br> <br>

    I arrive at the top and a man is there. At the top of the mountain stands a wooden playset that you would find in an old community park. The man sits over the edge of one of its platforms, just staring at the mountain scenery before him, facing me. He must have watched me come up here, saw me in the distance with my wheelchair. He doesn't say anything except for warning me about the bears. <br> <br>

    I remember. <br> <br>

    The mountain is cursed by the spirit of the forest surrounding it; despite there not being a single tree on this mountain, it is held as a sacred spot by the forest's bears. Thus, the bears can sense human presence. I find my rainbow vans at the base of the playground, but the laces were so tightly wound I had to loosen them before I could get them onto my feet. I hear rustling from the woods and a bear cub fumbles around toward the playground. The mysterious man tells me I should go.  He is an oshino type character. I fumble with my shoes; as I do this, the bear cub walks up to me, sniffs my arm, and flops over onto its back. It's cute. . . I want to pet it, but I resist the urge. I calmly but quickly make my way down the wooden stairs, past my wheelchair, toward the highway where the rest stop is in the distance. I find myself running now, a sense of urgency overtaking me. I look back and the man is nowhere in sight, and I am filled with fear for his well being. I run to my truck– which is now a moped– and hop on it, still feeling chased by this spirit bear forest being. <br> <br>

    I speed to find a cop, some kind of authority. I blabber nonsensically how there's a man in danger from bears on a forested mountain with no trees. The policeman understands, so he follows me back to the site. Nobody is there– but the mama bear comes out. To me, it meant certain death– so I just run without telling him and he gets eaten while I escape.  <br> <br>

    Later, I go to a thrift shop far away in a town I've never been to. There's high quality clothes hanging on display, but I don’t want to buy them. I see Jourdan there, and we talk but pretty much don't interact other than a few exchanges. There’s one shirt that looks cool.  <br> <br>

    I somehow found a pet bird whose name I couldn't decide on, so I named it something like Marcus-Penelope-ChiChi-Lou-Blue. I was this parrot’s best friend, and it could talk– not like a normal parrot, but like a human. We hung out and I was googling how to raise a bird. I felt observed by everybody important to me seeing if I was smart enough to raise a creature. So, I took great care of it and took it everywhere I went. He couldn't fly, but he could glide and flap his wings but he mostly just liked sitting in my hand, so I took him to a cross-country practice and showed him to all my teammates and he introduced himself and said hi like a little baby.   <br> <br>

    Later that day, I took him to a car race in a tunnel–like Nascar, but underground– also, everybody's cars are trains and the race is on subway rails. There's a ton of them, and they're all custom built and some trains even look like cars. Basically, I set Blue down on a table so I can go look at one of the trains in the tunnel; I don’t want to take him in there because I don't want the strong wind in the tunnels to blow him away.   <br> <br>

    When I come back, he's gone, and I feel decimated that I lost him. The rest of the dream is finding nemo-esque, just searching for my baby bird.
