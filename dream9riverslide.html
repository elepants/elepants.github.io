   Night of May 2, 2020.</h1>

    I am standing at the end of a line, barefoot, in a very thick forest. In the space immediately around me, there are about twenty other people, and in front of me there is a path cleared of any trees about forty feet across. We are all barefoot, but the grass we are standing on is luscious and so green and so unimaginably soft. I am standing behind someone whose name was unclear. In front of him was Eva. Right then is when I realize these are my friends from PEAK.  Looking further ahead, the front of the line is a large rock-surrounded pond that falls off the edge of a very smooth cliff. There are what seems to be a couple plastic tubs large enough to fit a person, each held by an adult chaperone. The chaperone was like those lifeguards who tell you when to go down the slide. Except… the slide is a natural, gently-sloped waterfall. <br> <br>

    This setting is at the top of one mountain: forested, very shady, lush. The river begins up here and goes down the mountain, following a very gentle, parabolic arc– it rises back up to the peak of another mountain in the distance, but it seems to cut the very rocky and barren mountain right in half, flowing straight through. I joke around with Eva and the guy in front of me– if we slid down, we might get stuck at the bottom of the valley between the two mountains… I laugh as I speak, fully intending it as a joke.  <br> <br> 

    The unidentified man becomes very serious and tells me that the water has magical properties that allow it to flow up the mountain. He says this as if just joking about that brings bad juju onto us. This whole time, the line is slowly getting shorter and shorter, and we get closer to the front as people depart in the weird water tubs. We can't see where the river ends, just that it goes through that mountain. It’s Eva’s turn. She goes without hesitation. The guy goes, and makes me promise him that I will find him “on the other side"...  <br> <br>

    It’s my turn. I climb into the seemingly very unstable plastic tub. As soon as I’m in, I am falling down this river, caught by the current, and rushed upward. It was so fun, for a moment. The wind and water sprayed my face and hair. I fell down and down and down, and then rose up and up and up.
     <br> <br>
    When I reached the peak of the distant mountain, everything went black.
     <br> <br>
    The dream shifts.
     <br> <br>
    I am home. The memory of the riverslide is just a faint dream in the back of my mind. I call Eva, telling her I want–I need–to go back to Wyoming. I'm desperate, crazy, rambling on about it. The whole time, she never considers talking me out of it, but instead asks me how we are going to get there. Flying is not even considered. We think of routes, highways, anything else... I suggest 69-south, because it can take me anywhere I want to be.   <br> <br>

    Suddenly, Eva says she will drive herself. At this abrupt silence in conversation, my phone rings–and it's him, the guy in front of me in line that day. The audio on the phone is really crackled, and I can't understand him. Desperate, I begin driving down 69-south, but there are so many police cars flashing. In my head, I see myself on a map– and I'm going the wrong way to Wyoming. Slamming on the brakes, I turn around. Though, at this point the entire prospect of getting there is completely out of my brain.  <br> <br>

    The dream shifts. <br> <br>

    I make it back home, but it is different. There is a dark vignette on the edges of my vision, and every corner, every ledge, and every crevice in my house is bathed in a thick shadow. I know it's daytime, but the windows just reveal opaque blackness. My parents, also standing in my kitchen, stare at me silently. I start walking toward my fridge and turn to look back at my parents, but they are gone, with wisps of smoke left in the air in their absence. I reach out my hand to open the fridge, and I see light wisps of smoke emanating from my body. I am not really frightened by this, but I feel disappointment. I'm dead. When I walk, it makes no sound, I don't have to breathe, but I can feel a restless energy in my chest.. I don't know where my parents went, but I decide that I do not want to follow them. <br> <br>

    Day breaks, and the windows appear back to normal. It is the day of Relay for Life, but it is set up in my cul de sac, all the way down my street. None of my neighbors are home, or if they are, they do not come out. The main event is Paul (the band) performing rap god, except Caden is rapping it and also he kind of sucks at it. Ben is killing the synth part with his guitar. I walk past them and see a friend. I don’t know who it is. No face or identity, I just know we are friends. They ask me why I'm here. I tell them I am dead, but that I just want to have some fun. They don't believe me. How could I be dead? A small, itchy feeling creeps toward my hands from my chest and instinctively I feel myself reaching my arm out towards their head, and pulling very lightly.  <br> <br>

    Their soul comes a little less than halfway out of their body before I release my grip. Because I did that, they are thrown out of and back into consciousness. They believe me now. I can understand the feeling they had just experienced; dark void, unfeeling. It felt like I had been there before, but that I should stay in my current form so as to avoid an obligation of being there. I continue to walk around and talk to people. and it is here that I discover that i can't eat food, it just tastes absolutely abominable. I am mildly disappointed about this.  <br> <br>

    Soon, the festivities become too loud. I walk down my cul de sac toward Jay's house. I head to the side of his house, and sit in the grassy, bright space there. I had never felt so relaxed here, and it is when I realize that the ground is so soft, the grass is so lush and the houses around me have become trees. a small brook flows in the distance. I feel at peace here, and the dream ends with me resting here, laying against a tree. I am back on top of the first mountain.  <br> <br>
