    <h1 style="font-family:'blockgame'; font-size: 24px;"> Meteor III <br>
   Night of June 2, 2020.</h1>

    It is predicted with complete certainty that within the next 24 hours, a meteor is going to strike the northern hemisphere and entirely eradicate all of its inhabitants. I learn of this news at a piano lesson, except Ashley's house is Jourdan’s house. <br> <br>

    Ashley’s husband isn't home, and neither is her toddler. It is just us and her 9 year old daughter. Upon hearing the news auto-play from both our phones, we remain pretty quiet until she excuses herself to go upstairs to talk to her daughter. I don't know what she says, but I hear her eventually say, "no, no, please don't cry," and then the sounds of her daughter sobbing. I figure it is time to leave.  <br> <br>

    Upon stepping outside, I take in the sky that has turned a sad orange-brown, and I worry that I don't have enough time to get home. I turn my car radio on–every channel is set to NASA's broadcast, their prophecy of the end. My mind fills with resolve: I will have time.  <br> <br>

    I drive home, jump out of my car, and race inside. But my family isn't here. I feel alone. I don't want to die, and I don’t want to die alone. Though, at the same time, the idea of the meteor feels bittersweet. I walk into my parent's empty room and lay in the middle of their bed, breathing in their scents. Looking up, above me is a skylight which allows me to see not a giant meteor, but an oddly beautiful dimming sky full of orange and brown streaks and brightening stars.  <br> <br>

    I lay there, contemplating the end– for everybody I know, and everybody in this country, this hemisphere. It was such an odd feeling.  <br> <br>

    Close to the end, I decide that I want to die praying, as if it would make a difference in my moral standing with God. I find myself begging for mercy after I die, then moving into an examination of my own conscience, and finally repeating the Hail Mary over and over. On my third one, I realize Molly Thomas is across the room, praying quietly with me and holding a rosary. The longer we pray, the more people appear in the room. Eva appears next, Cidney, and then just a horde of my friends. We all stand in a circle and exist in silence. Soon we hear NASA counting down from ten, quite slowly. A few of us are quietly crying, but mostly it's just silence. I remember saying something to the effect of "well guys. i guess it was good while it lasted" and the man on the radio counted the last numbers. <br> <br>
    We held our breaths, but nothing ever happened. Slowly, we began to move again and eventually we grew into laughter, hysterics at the hilarity of the situation. The tension disappeared from the room. After a few minutes, we figured it was merely a miscalculation and that we were still living on borrowed time. Spirits again decreased. <br> <br>

    Hours later, we are all home. I turn on my TV to find that the meteor actually hit India and decimated the entirety of her side of the world. Instead of us, it was them, I remember thinking. <br> <br>
    It wasn't a happy moment, though. It felt like a betrayal, to feel so close to death, and accept it, and then have that taken from you. <br> <br>
